"""Compare the CMIP6 historical period against ERA5.

We might want to load the raw variables, or the derived variables like potential intensity and potential size.

For each ensemble member then might want to calculate the mean bias for each grid point for each variable, but also if this bias has a trend, and perhaps how significant the bias is.

For the ensemble as a whole we might want to compare how the distribution of mean biases and their trends compare, and whether there are significant difference between different families of models.
